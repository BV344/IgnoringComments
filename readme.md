# Instructions for compilation and use with Linux:
To compile on Linux, use the "make" command in the root directory to use the Makefile.

Then use the following command to use the program.
- ./IgnoreComments {path to file}

The output will appear in the same directory as the file, with "-comments_replaced_with_whitespace.c"
