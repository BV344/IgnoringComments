1. **File Reading Component**:
    
    - Responsible for reading the input file line by line.
    - Handles file opening, reading, and closing operations.
    - Provides each line to the next component for processing.
2. **Comment Detection Component**:
    
    - Utilizes a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) to identify comments.
    - It should have different states to handle different types of comments (C block-style and C++ style).
    - It must be able to detect unterminated C block-style comments and output an error with the line number.
3. **Comment Removal Component**:
    
    - Responsible for removing comments and replacing them with whitespace.
    - It should preserve the line numbering of the original input.
    - This component will be closely tied with the DFA, as the DFA's state will determine when and what to remove.
4. **Output Component**:
    
    - Handles the creation of the output file.
    - Writes the processed lines, now without comments or with comments replaced by whitespace, to a new file.
5. **Main Control Component**:
    
    - The 'main' function that controls the flow of the program.
    - Initializes and orchestrates the other components.
    - Handles any command-line arguments if necessary.
6. **Error Handling Component**:
    
    - Manages any errors that occur, especially for file operations and unterminated comments.
    - Outputs error messages with relevant information (like line numbers).
7. **Testing and Validation Component**:
    
    - Not a part of the main program, but essential for development.
    - Includes a suite of tests to ensure each component and the entire program work as expected.
